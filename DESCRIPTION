Title: Assay characterization: estimation of limit of blanc(LoB) and limit of detection(LOD)
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 2021-04-12
Description: The MSstatsLOBD package allows calculation and visualization of 
    limit of blac (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD). We define the LOB as the 
    highest apparent concentration of a peptide expected when replicates of a 
    blank sample containing no peptides are measured. The LOD is defined as the 
    measured concentration value for which the probability of falsely claiming 
    the absence of a peptide in the sample is 0.05, given a probability 0.05 of 
    falsely claiming its presence. These functionalities were previously 
    a part of the MSstats package. The methodology is described
    in Galitzine (2018) <doi:10.1074/mcp.RA117.000322>.
